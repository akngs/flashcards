"Men explain things to me, and other women, whether or not they know what they’re talking about. Some men. Every woman knows what I’m talking about."
"I’ve learned that a certain amount of self-doubt is a good tool for correcting, understanding, listening, and progressing—though too much is paralyzing and total self-confidence produces arrogant idiots. There’s a happy medium between these poles to which the genders have been pushed, a warm equatorial belt of give and take where we should all meet."
Middle Eastern countries where women’s testimony has no legal standing: so that a woman can’t testify that she was raped without a male witness to counter the male rapist.
We are all cognitive cyborgs in this Internet age in the sense that we rely heavily on cognitive tools to amplify our mental abilities.
"According to this new view, visual thinking is a process that has the allocation of attention as its very essence. Attention, however, is multifaceted. Making an eye movement is an act of attending. The image on the retina is analyzed by further attention-related processes that tune our pattern-finding mechanisms to pull out the pattern most likely to help with whatever we are doing."
"Visual thinking consists of a series of acts of attention, driving eye movements and tuning our pattern-finding circuits."
The non-uniformity of the visual processing power is such that half our visual brain power is directed to processing less than 5 percent of the visual world. This is why we have to move our eyes; it is the only way we can get all that brain power directed where it will be most useful.
"Strong eye muscles attached to each eyeball rotate it rapidly so that different parts of the visual world become imaged on the central high-resolution fovea. The muscles accelerate the eyeball to an angular velocity up to 900 degrees per second, then stop it, all in less than one-tenth of a second."
"The idea of distributed cognition is no longer particularly controversial, but the idea of distributed cognition begs to be extended outside the head, and this is truly radical."
"One reason design is difficult is that the designer already has the knowledge expressed in the design, has seen it develop from inception, and therefore cannot see it with fresh eyes. The solution is to be analytic and this is where this book is intended to have value."
"Note that although the black-white channel combines two type of cone information, it also differentiates in a spatial sense. Black-white differences are calculated simultaneously between all adjacent regions in the retina."
"Some depth cues are not captured in a static image, and are therefore not pictorial."
Stereoscopic vision is optimal for visually guiding our hands as we reach for nearby objects.
"Affordances are ultimately about linking perception and action, and there are pathways in the brain that are specialized for this task. The where pathway runs forward from V1 and V2 to the parietal lobe in the middle of the upper part of the brain."
"When we look at something, perhaps 95 percent of what we consciously perceive is not what is “out there” but what is already in our heads in long-term memory."
"In visual thinking, perception is a kind of cognitive action sequence, not some static registering of the external world. Long-term memory results from a strengthening of neural connections, increasing the likelihood that a particular neural chain reaction will occur."
A dialogue is a type of goal-directed conversation in which two participants (in the minimal case) are participating by taking turns. At each move one party responds to the previous move of the other party. Thus each dialogue is a connected sequence of moves (speech acts) that has a direction of flow.
"The concept of a proposition is fundamental to critical argumentation, because arguments are made up of premises and conclusions that are propositions."
"Ambiguous sentences do contain propositions. But an ambiguous sentence is not itself a proposition. The reason is that it does not have the property, by itself, of being true or false."
There is a distinction that is fundamental to critical argumentation that will run through this whole book. This is the distinction between asserting a proposition and questioning a proposition.
"When you question a proposition, you are not necessarily making a claim that the proposition is false, or that it is true. Questioning expresses a neutral point of view if it is merely an expression of doubt. For doubt does not need to imply belief or commitment."
Inconsistency can be defined as follows. Two statements are inconsistent if it’s not logically possible for both of them to be true.
One very common form of deductive argument that it is important to know about is called the syllogism.
"When new information comes in, a presumptively reasonable argument that was plausible in the old situation may now have to be re-assessed as no longer plausible (by default). Hence it is important not to become too rigid or dogmatic in reliance on stereotypes in plausible argumentation."
